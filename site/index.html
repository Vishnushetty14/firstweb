The campus is located in an ideal environment in Nagadenahalli on the highway, close to Bengaluru International Airport and at a distance of 3.5 km from Doddaballapur Railway Station. The campus is provided with smart classrooms, laboratories, auditoria, seminar halls, play fields, student hostels and other student support services.

The campus is located near the IT hub of the city. The campus has two academic blocks, one spacious library building, an administrative block and two hostels. All the academic departments have adequate number of smart classrooms, staff rooms, seminar halls well- equipped laboratories, central library, and other facilities.
